A personal ranker that allows you to rank and sort your own Top 7 (tba) for Mnet's idol survival show I-LAND 2, the sequel to I-LAND. It currently has functionality for adding and removing trainees on the table through click, sorting them on the ranking itself through drag & drop, and activating filters that show which contestants have been eliminated or currently hold a Top 7 (tba) position. It is also possible to save a link of your current ranking to revisit it as the episodes progress.

Note: For now, the color borders around each contestant corresponds to which dance performance they were in. This is subject to change.
